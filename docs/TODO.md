## TODO (someday)

* Save document-specific runtime parameters
  - scroll position
  - problems processing document (missing programs, errors)
* Sync scrollbar positions between preview and document.
* Process only a portion of the page to improve performance
  - Is it possible to update only changes to integrate with the rest?
  - Or preview only part of the document around the current position?
* Graphical configuration panel?
  - or at least open config file in Geany?
* Check if external programs exist before trying to use them
