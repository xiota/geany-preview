## TODO (someday)

* Detect and process other document types
  - fountain screenplays
* Add preferences
  - Change the default font family and size
  - Apply a default stylesheet
  - Change the timer interval (for asciidoctor)
  - Use other text processors
  - Turn on/off formats (asciidoctor)
* Save scroll position for each document.
* Sync preview and document scrollbar positions.
* Partial page updates to improve performance (asciidoc)
  - Is it possible to update only changes to integrate with the rest?
  - Or preview only part of the document around the current position?
